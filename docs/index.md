## Overview

Arrow Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows archers to:

- Log practice sessions and track progress
- Record and analyze shots in "ends" (groups of shots)
- Manage equipment and preferences
- View statistics and progress over time
- Track weather conditions during practice
- Access data offline in the field

The application is built with a React frontend and Azure Functions backend, providing a seamless experience across devices with offline capabilities.
