## Notes
- The client application will follow a mobile-first approach as specified in the requirements.
- Offline-first architecture is critical for field usage during archery practice.
- The initial setup will focus on the core infrastructure without implementing all features.
- We'll use TypeScript for type safety throughout the application.
- The PWA will be designed to work seamlessly with the Azure Functions backend (to be set up in a separate task).

## Outcomes
The initial client setup for the Arrow Tracker PWA has been successfully completed:

- Created a React application with TypeScript and PWA capabilities
- Implemented Material UI for a responsive, mobile-friendly interface
- Set up Redux for state management with proper slicing by domain
- Configured authentication using MSAL.js for Azure AD B2C
- Implemented API client with caching for offline capabilities
- Created core screens including login, dashboard, and practice session creation
- Set up testing framework with Jest and React Testing Library
- Configured CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Organized codebase using a feature-based architecture for maintainability

This initial setup provides a solid foundation for implementing the remaining features of the Arrow Tracker application.
